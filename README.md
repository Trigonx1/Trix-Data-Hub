## Data Modelling
The data model follows a star schema, consisting of:

* 1 Fact Table: containing sales transactions, profit, and quantity data.

* 4 Dimension Tables: Country, Brand, Operator, and Distributor.

## A Calendar Table  was also created using DAX for time intelligence functions (e.g., monthly and yearly comparisons).
Relationships were defined using primary and foreign keys to ensure optimal model performance.

## Report Design and Visualization
The dashboard was designed with a deep blue and white professional theme for readability and corporate appeal.

* The layout background was designed in PowerPoint, imported into Power BI as a canvas background.

* Two report pages were developed:

1 Summary Page ‚Äì for overall business performance.

2  Breakdown Page ‚Äì for detailed analysis by brand, operator, and distributor

5 pages were created; Home, Consolidated, Stationery, Cosmetics and Electronics. 
_Home_ page is the landing page while _Consolidated_ has the general report without filter while other pages has filtered reports accroding to their page name.
On each page, the new card visual is used to hold Total Sales, Gross Sales and Profit, Line Chart is used for the series analysis while a column and bar chart are adopted for the Continental and Country analysis respectively. The last image is the button for page navigation.

2. Haut‚Äôs management should continue their market strategy that leads to higher profits and better customer satisfaction
3. The cosmetics product category demands more research and development to boost its sales and profitability
